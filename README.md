# Finding Frequent Patterns with Apriori Algorithm in Digikala Dataset
The purpose of this project is to design a GUI to analyze purchase patterns in the Digi Kala company database. For this purpose, it is necessary to create a graphical environment to receive the required input information from the user and, according to his request, filter the data in the selected time and location range. Then, with the help of the Apriori algorithm in the mlxtend library, purchase pattern analysis is performed on the filtered data and the results are displayed in the graphical environment in the form of a table. In this project, the pandas library was used to filter the data, so it was necessary to create the ability to display the output of this library in the graphical environment because the designed tables could not display Dataframes. For this purpose, first the libraries required for data filtering, data analysis, and GUI design were added to the programming environment.
